# dotfiles
My dotfiles repo and bootstrapping script for Arch and Fedora currently.
This does not install desktop environments or anything, you'll still have to do that manually!
However, it does install most of the applications I use on my computer, if on Arch or Fedora.

# installation of everything
You will be asked for your root password throughout the install!
```
$ ./install.sh
```

# installation of ONLY dotfiles
```
$ scripts/install-dotfiles.sh
```
